# Olympic-Medals

This project, documented in the Olympic Medals focuses on analyzing Summer Olympic medal data from 1976 to 2008.

The key steps and components of the project include:

Data Loading and Initial Exploration: The project begins by loading the "Summer-Olympic-medals-1976-to-2008.csv" dataset using pandas. It then performs initial data exploration by:
Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
Checking data types and non-null counts of columns.
Generating descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
Listing all column names.
Counting unique values in each column.
Identifying the sum of null values in each column.
Data Cleaning: The notebook includes steps to clean the data, such as dropping duplicate rows and removing rows with any missing values. It also cleans column names by stripping leading/trailing whitespace.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis section. A specific example of EDA shown is plotting the number of medals by country.
The project utilizes Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and matplotlib.pyplot along with seaborn for data visualization.
